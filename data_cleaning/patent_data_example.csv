US-10168706-B1,"An autonomous vehicle detects a tailgating vehicle and uses various response mechanisms. A vehicle is identified as a tailgater based on whether its characteristics meet a variable threshold. When the autonomous vehicle is traveling at slower speeds, the threshold is defined in distance. When the autonomous vehicle is traveling at faster speeds, the threshold is defined in time. The autonomous vehicle responds to the tailgater by modifying its driving behavior. In one example, the autonomous vehicle adjusts a headway buffer (defined in time) from another vehicle in front of the autonomous vehicle. In this regard, if the tailgater is T seconds too close to the autonomous vehicle, the autonomous vehicle increases the headway buffer to the vehicle in front of it by some amount relative to T.","B62D15/00, B60W60/0015, B60W2554/80, B62D15/025, G05D1/00, B60W30/14, B60W60/00, B60W2554/00, B60W2754/10, B60W2554/802, B60W60/001, B60W2520/10, G05D1/02, B60W2520/00, B60W2754/00, B60W2754/30, B62D15/0255, B60W30/16, G05D1/021, G05D1/0287, B62D15/02, B60W60/0016, B60W2554/801, G05D1/0055, B60W30/00, B60W2550/30","{'2017-11-29': 'Priority to US15/825,883', '2017-12-11': 'Assigned to GOOGLE INC.', '2017-12-12': 'Assigned to WAYMO HOLDING INC.', '2017-12-13': 'Assigned to WAYMO LLC', '2018-12-05': 'Priority to US16/210,701', '2019-01-01': 'Publication of US10168706B1', '2021-06-14': 'Priority to US17/346,544', 'Status': 'Active', '2033-07-24': 'Anticipated expiration'}",{'US11656623B1': 'Waymo Llc'},{}

US-10169445-B2,"In the present work, quantum clustering is extended to provide a dynamical approach for data clustering using a time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation. To expedite computations, we can approximate the time-dependent Hamiltonian formalism by a truncated calculation within a set of Gaussian wave-functions (coherent states) centered around the original points. This allows for analytic evaluation of the time evolution of all such states, opening up the possibility of exploration of relationships among data points through observation of varying dynamical-distances among points and convergence of points into clusters. This formalism may be further supplemented by preprocessing, such as dimensional reduction through singular value decomposition and/or feature filtering. Additionally, the parameters of the analysis can be modified in order to improve the efficiency of the dynamic quantum clustering processes.","G06V10/763, G06F16/20, G06F18/21, G06F18/00, G06F18/2135, G06F16/28, G06V10/00, G06V10/762, G06K9/6247, G06F18/23, G06F16/284, G06F18/20, G06F17/30601, G06F18/232, G06F16/00, G06F18/213, G06F16/287, G06K9/622, G06V10/70, G06F16/285","{'2009-09-15': 'Priority claimed from US12/586,036', '2014-09-22': 'Priority to US14/492,677', '2015-02-12': 'Publication of US20150046457A1', '2015-03-09': 'Assigned to THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY', '2019-01-01': 'Publication of US10169445B2', '2021-11-22': 'Assigned to UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY', 'Status': 'Active', '2031-05-31': 'Adjusted expiration'}","{'US11270221B2': 'International Business Machines Corporation', 'US11537926B2': 'D-Wave Systems Inc.', 'US11593174B2': 'D-Wave Systems Inc.', 'US11593695B2': 'D-Wave Systems Inc.', 'US20230214454A1': 'International Business Machines Corporation', 'US11704586B2': 'D-Wave Systems Inc.', 'US11714730B2': 'D-Wave Systems Inc.', 'US11809959B2': 'Microsoft Technology Licensing, Llc', 'US11921755B2': 'International Business Machines Corporation'}",{}

US-10171084-B2,"Sparse representation of information performs powerful feature extraction on high-dimensional data and is of interest for applications in signal processing, machine vision, object recognition, and neurobiology. Sparse coding is a mechanism by which biological neural systems can efficiently process complex sensory data while consuming very little power. Sparse coding algorithms in a bio-inspired approach can be implemented in a crossbar array of memristors (resistive memory devices). This network enables efficient implementation of pattern matching and lateral neuron inhibition, allowing input data to be sparsely encoded using neuron activities and stored dictionary elements. The reconstructed input can be obtained by performing a backward pass through the same crossbar matrix using the neuron activity vector as input. Different dictionary sets can be trained and stored in the same system, depending on the nature of the input signals. Using the sparse coding algorithm, natural image processing is performed based on a learned dictionary.","G06N3/063, G06F17/00, G06F9/00, G11C13/00, G11C13/0021, G06N3/06, H04L49/10, G11C13/0069, G11C2213/00, H03K19/177, H03K19/17748, H04Q11/00, G06F9/30, G11C13/0007, H04L49/101, G11C2213/70, H03K19/173, H04Q3/00, H04L49/00, G06F17/16, H03K19/00, G06F9/30036, G06N3/02, G06F17/10, G11C13/0002, G06F9/30003, G06F9/06, G06F9/30007, H04Q3/0004, H03K19/02, G11C2213/77, G06N3/00","{'2018-04-24': 'Priority to US15/960,772', '2018-07-10': 'Assigned to THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN', '2018-10-25': 'Publication of US20180309451A1', '2018-12-28': 'Priority to US16/235,115', '2019-01-01': 'Publication of US10171084B2', '2019-10-30': 'Priority to US16/669,324', 'Status': 'Active', '2038-04-24': 'Anticipated expiration'}","{'US10943652B2': 'The Regents Of The University Of Michigan', 'US20220029665A1': 'Electronics And Telecommunications Research Institute', 'US11275968B2': 'Western Digital Technologies, Inc.'}",{}
US-10171144-B2,"A low complexity multiple input multiple output transmitter that transmits a single codeword per channel is disclosed herein. Instead of sending multiple codewords per channel for transmissions that support higher data layer transmissions, the transmitter can send single codewords over multiple channels in order to improve spectral efficiency over a range of signal to interference plus noise ratios. For instance, if a downlink transmission to a user equipment (UE) has a rank of 4, capable of supporting 4 data layers, instead of sending 2 or more codewords over a single downlink control channel, the transmitter can schedule multiple control channels and transmit a single codeword per channel. The transmitter can also include in the signaling to the UE that the multi-codewords are included in multiple downlink control channels.","H04B7/04, H04B7/00, H04B7/0413, H04B7/0478, H04B7/02, H04B7/0456, H04B7/0417","{'2017-03-24': 'Application filed by AT&T Intellectual Property I LP', '2017-08-14': 'Assigned to AT&T INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY I, L.P.', '2018-03-02': 'Priority to PCT/US2018/020750', '2018-09-27': 'Publication of US20180278305A1', '2018-10-22': 'Priority to US16/166,473', '2019-01-01': 'Application granted', '2019-05-14': 'Assigned to AT&T INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY I, L.P.', '2019-09-26': 'Priority to US16/584,011', '2021-02-04': 'Priority to US17/167,827', '2022-06-24': 'Priority to US17/849,116', 'Status': 'Active', '2037-03-24': 'Anticipated expiration'}",{},{}

In particular embodiments, a different objective is used: rather than looking for a state which approximately solves an optimization problem, embodiments of the disclosed technology find a quantum algorithm that will produce a state with high overlap with the optimal state (given an instance, for example, of MAX-2-SAT). In certain embodiments, a machine learning approach is used in which a âtraining setâ of problems is selected and the parameters optimized to produce large overlap for this training set. The problem was then tested on a larger problem set. When tested on the full set, the parameters that were found produced significantly larger overlap than optimized annealing times. Testing on other random instances (e.g., from 20 to 28 bits) continued to show improvement over annealing, with the improvement being most notable on the hardest problems.

The facility identifies dominant color regions within the tissue data and identifies seed points within those regions using, for example, a radial symmetry based approach. Based at least in part on those seed points, the facility generates a tessellation, each distinct area in the tessellation corresponding to a distinct detected object. These objects are then classified using the previously-trained classifier. The facility uses the classified objects to score slides.","G06T7/11, G06T2207/00, G06T7/0012, G06T2207/30004, G06T2207/20, G06T2207/30068, G06T7/0014, G06V20/698, G06V20/695, G06T2207/30, G06V20/69, G06V20/00, G06T2207/30024, G06T7/00, G06T2207/20081, G06T2207/20156, G06T7/10, G06T7/0002, G06K9/0014, G06T2207/20112, G06V20/60, G06K9/00147","{'2014-03-12': 'Priority to US14/776,571', '2016-02-11': 'Publication of US20160042511A1', '2017-07-18': 'Assigned to VENTANA MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.', '2019-01-08': 'Publication of US10176579B2', 'Status': 'Active', '2034-03-12': 'Anticipated expiration'}","{'US20180232883A1': 'Amit Sethi', 'US10803586B1': 'Aiforia Technologies Oy', 'US11798165B2': 'Sony Group Corporation'}",{}
